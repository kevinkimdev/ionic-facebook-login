# Facebook Authentication in Ionic 4 Apps

This repo is an Ionic v4 starter app to show you how to add Facebook Log In to an Ionic App. There is also a [detailed tutorial](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/facebook-authentication-in-ionic3-apps) to help you with the Facebook setup and with the step by step of building this Ionic Framework app.


For this Ionic example app we are going to build a simple ionic 4 app that allows users to log in using their Facebook account. Once they log in, they will see a home page with their basic profile info.
